# -Personal-Desktop-Assistant

<strong>Description</strong>

The project aims to develop a personal-assistant for Windows-based systems. NOVA draws its 
inspiration from virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows, and Siri for iOS. It has been 
designed to provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing 
certain well-defined commands. Users can interact with the assistant either through voice 
commands or using keyboard input. 
As a personal assistant, NOVA assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like general 
human conversation, searching queries in google, searching for videos, retrieving images, live 
weather conditions, word meanings, searching for medicine details, health recommendations 
based on symptoms and reminding the user about the scheduled events and tasks. The user 
statements/commands are analysed with the help of If-Else ladder to give an optimal solution.
